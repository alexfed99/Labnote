Summary:

##### Fluo-4 and NP-EGTA loading to HEK293 cells(old)

Process:

1.1. Add 0.3 ul Fluo-4 AM solution (final concentration of 2 uM) to 1.5 ml eppendorf 

1.2. Add 0.5 ul NP-EGTA  solution (final concentration of 5 uM) to 1.5 ml eppendorf (with Fluo-4)

1.3 500 ul Outside Solution and pippete around 20 times 

##### Loading

2.1. Take 12-well culture plate from CO2-incubator and choose the well for preparation using inverted microscope

2.2. Put culture plate to the BSC work surface

2.3. Sterilize tweezers using 96% ethanol: dip tweezers tip into  alcohol, burn it and wait until it goes out. Carefully, put tweezers  from the work surface. 

2.4. Open the culture plate and grab the cover glass over the edge  with tweezers, transfer it to Petri dish

(NOTE: Осмолярность была доведена Outside Solution -1 ml)

2.5. Add loading solution (0.5 ml) 

2.6. Place petri dish into CO2-incubator, load at 37oC for 37-40 min

2.7. Wash cells after loading to eliminate further loading by 1.5 ml of the Outside Solution

2.8 Leave for 10-15 min for complete deesterification
