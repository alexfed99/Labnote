### Solution preparing

#####     *Trypsin 0,25% (Sigma T4799) with PBS*

1. To dry sample 25 mg trypsin + 10 ml PBS + 18 mg glucose (Glucose SIGMA G8270). Stir on a magnetic stirrer until complete dissolution (long! Up to 1 hour).

2. Filtering (0.22 μm) in 1.5 ml-Eppendorf, by 0.5 ml of solution. (Eppendorf pre-UV). Freeze verticallyю

   ##### Poly-L-Lysine (PLL)/ Poly-D-Lysine(PDL)(Sigma-Aldrich P6407)/ Poly-D-L-Ornitine (PDLO), stock(10 mg/ml in H2O)

   Add water to a branded jar with 5 mg dry poly-lysine (0.5 ml sterile H2O). Aliquot 25 μl and store frozen (-4 *)

   ##### Laminin, Mouse, Natural (Invitrogen(Gibco)23017-015), stock (1 mg/ml in H2O)

   Add water to a branded jar with 1 mg dry laminin (1 ml sterile H2O). Aliquot 25 μl and store frozen (-4 *)

   

   ### The day before passage

   ##### 1) If there are no prepared glasses, then prepare the glasses (See: Preparing the glasses)

   ##### 2) Cover the glasses (See: Cover glasses)

   **3) Sterilize a Petri dish (60mm) with a lid and 2 filter circles inside, wrapped in heat-resistant paper within 90 min at 180* in the oven, then put it into freezer**

   **4) Check the Trypsin and MEM solution (must be at least 20 ml), prepare if it`s absent**

   **5) Check the nozzles for the 1 ml dispenser (must be at least 10 p.)**

   

   ### The day of passage 

   **1) Place in a laminar and UV for 15 min:**

   **-Tissue extraction instruments, copiously splashed with alcohol**

   **-Tips for pipetts**

   **-Dispencers**

   **-5 ml epp. and 2 epp(1,5 ml) + tripod for 5 ml epp.**

   **-Container for drain**

   **2) The tube with 0,25-0,5 ml Trypsin 0,25% in PBS put into thermostat for _>20 min. (max.activity -34-37C)**

   *MEM+ or MEM- (if we need to prepare solution)

   **3) Remove the liquid from the glass covered the day before and leave to dry with open lid**

   **4) Take from the freezer a box of ice and  a sterile Petri dish(60 mm)  with lid and 2 filter circles inside. Filters in the lid wet with MEM-. Put the lid on the ice on the table for tissue extraction. Left from the ice - put a Petri dish, right from the ice - put the instruments and the lid from instrument box. Convenient to place the large and small spatula, tweezers with sharp curved ends, scissors with sharp curved ends, scalpel in lid from instrument box.  Near the Petri dish - lerge scissors and large tweezers. **

   **5) Holding the animal with the left hand over the P.dish, quickly decapitate with large scissors. Grab head by the nose with tweezers. Sprinkle with 70% alcohol. Select the hippocampus. (See pictures) Cut each piece into several parts and transfer to a solution of Trypsin (0.25%) in PBS (or MEM-) t = 37* and put it in a thermostat at t = 37 (for 10 minutes)**

   **6) After 10 minutes:**

   - **+1 ml of cold culture medium (MEM +) * into a 5 ml tube.**

   - **Carefully take out the suspension of tissue pieces (0.5-1 ml with a dispenser) with the same spout. Place in MEM + (from point 1) **

   - **Disperse the tissue (using a dispenser with a 1 ml spout) to a more or less homogeneous suspension (20 times)**

   - **Add cold MEM + for 12 wells, 200 μl each (1 plate for 12 wells) + another 1400 μl (with a pipette, 2 times 700 each) **

   - **Add 200 μl to each well in the center of the glass. **

   - ##### Hold the plate for 1 hour in an incubator. Add in each well - warm (kept in an incubator) culture medium MEM + to a final volume of 1 ml

   *Cold MEM deactivates Trypsin

   

   ### After passage, every 5-7 days

   Change 0,2 ml of culturing medium for 0,3 ml fresh medium, during 2-3 weeks.
